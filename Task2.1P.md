# App Attack 

## Overview, Goals and Objectives

The goal of AppAttack is to provide a thorough security analysis of
ThotTech's OnTrack Project, a web application that instructors and
students use for formal assessment in coursework-based topics. To find
vulnerabilities and improve the project's overall security posture, the
focus will be on doing a secure code review and penetration test. The
goal of AppAttack is to provide a thorough security analysis of
ThotTech's OnTrack Project, a web application that instructors and
students use for formal assessment in coursework-based topics. To find
vulnerabilities and improve the project's overall security posture, the
focus will be on doing a secure code review and penetration test.

All team members participating in the testing may access a secure,
sandboxed OnTrack environment that AppAttack has set up and housed
within a Kali Linux virtual machine. A forked copy of the code is used
to build this sandboxed instance, ensuring a controlled testing
environment while protecting the privacy of the live system. To
thoroughly examine OnTrack for flaws in its security posture, code
errors, and vulnerabilities, testers will assume the viewpoint of
external attackers. We employ both automatic and manual attack
techniques to thoroughly evaluate OnTrack's security. After the
assessment is finished, AppAttack will provide ThotTech with a thorough
security report that lists all vulnerabilities found and suggests fixes.

This study will improve the security status of the OnTrack application
by providing guidelines for properly hardening the application and its
underlying code. AppAttack hopes to provide ThotTech with useful
insights to strengthen the security of the OnTrack Project with this
thorough security evaluation.

## Aim for the Trimester

Establishing a fruitful partnership with ThotTech's Ontrack Project is
the main goal of AppAttack, with an emphasis on carrying out a
comprehensive security assessment of their web application. AppAttack
simultaneously looks at potential joint ventures with other Capstone
firms. AppAttack hopes to create a collaborative atmosphere through this
effort where our experience in secure code review and penetration
testing can be used to different projects, providing a synergistic
effect. By working together, we hope to maximise the effectiveness of
our security evaluations and promote the sharing of knowledge.

## Trimester Deliverables

- Pentest and SCR Finding and Remediation Report: A thorough report
  including the findings from secure code reviews and penetration tests,
  as well as suggested corrective actions.

- Sandboxed testing environment hosting: To enable safe testing and
  experimentation, a sandboxed testing environment may be established
  inside a virtual machine.

- Planning and Reporting for Incident Response: creating an incident
  response strategy and offering a thorough report on how it was carried
  out.

- Strengthen Security standing: set measures in place to strengthen the
  security position of the organization.

## Long-Term Deliverables

- Collaboration Establishments with other capstone projects: Forming
  partnerships with additional capstone projects to encourage the
  exchange of knowledge and promote synergy.

- Research and build upon AppAttack Future vision: Conducting research
  and refining the long-term vision for the advancement and prosperity
  of AppAttack.

- Update upskilling resources and testing methodologies: Regularly
  updating resources for skills enhancement and testing techniques to
  ensure they are up to date.

- Establish a safe security culture amongst team members: Cultivating a
  secure culture within the team by fostering awareness and
  accountability for cybersecurity.

To meet our objectives for this trimester and provide the groundwork for
AppAttack's ongoing development and success, these deliverables are
crucial.
